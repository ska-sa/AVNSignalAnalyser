This software was developed initially by Craig Tong for use in AVN Ghana.
It is a QT desktop application which connects to a running single-dish
backend and allows controlling the ROACH, recording data files, etc. as
well as real-time visibility into what the RF signal-chain is doing.

The functionality has largely been superceded by the CAM system for AVN
Ghana. This repo is therefore retained only for historical purposes.
